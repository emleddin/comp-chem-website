## About this Site {#ab-site}
My colleagues asked for my research guides to be put on the Internet.
This is my first attempt at doing that.

## About the Guides {#ab-guides}

The guides were adapted from the manuals that
[Dr. Bill Miller III](http://brmiller.sites.truman.edu/) provides
his undergraduate research students. They've evolved a bit since then.

The [Unix Guide](UNIXguide-introduction.html) gives an overview of UNIX systems
and basic commands to get someone started with using the command line.

The [AMBER Guide](AMBER-introduction.html) covers wh

The [Simulation Analysis Guide](Analysis-introduction.html)

The [R Guide](R-introduciton.html) includes some basics for getting started R
programming language.


## Resources, Resources, Resources {#resources}

There are a *lot* of resources for getting started with computational chemistry,
and I've outlined a few here.
