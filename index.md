## About this Site {#ab-site}
My colleagues asked for my research guides to be put on the Internet.
This is my first attempt at doing that.

## About the Guides {#ab-guides}

The guides were adapted from the manuals that
[Dr. Bill Miller III](http://brmiller.sites.truman.edu/) provides
his undergraduate research students. They've evolved a bit since then.

The [Unix Guide](UNIXguide-introduction.html) gives an overview of UNIX systems
and basic commands to get someone started with using the command line. A PDF
of this guide is available [here](pdf/UNIXguide.pdf).

The [AMBER Guide](AMBERguide-introduction.html) covers how to set-up AMBER
simulations and a general overview of molecular dynamics simulations. A PDF
of this guide is available [here](pdf/AMBERguide.pdf).

The [Simulation Analysis Guide](Analysisguide-introduction.html) addresses how
to use some of the tools to analyze AMBER trajectories, visualizing data,
and presenting data in a useful manner through images and videos. A PDF
of this guide is available [here](pdf/Analysisguide.pdf).

The [R Guide](R-introduction.html) includes some basics for getting started
with the R programming language. A PDF of this guide is available
[here](pdf/Rguide.pdf).

## Resources, Resources, Resources {#resources}

There are a *lot* of resources for getting started with computational chemistry,
and I've outlined a few here.

### Tutorials {#tuts}

* [UNIX/Linux Tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
* [AMBER Tutorials](http://ambermd.org/tutorials/)

### Software/Programs
#### Terminal Emulators
Mac and Linux both come with a Terminal application, however, some users
may prefer to use a different emulator instead.
Windows users *must* use an emulator, as there is no native Terminal.
