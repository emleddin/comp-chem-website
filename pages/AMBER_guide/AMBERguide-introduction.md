AMBER (Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement) is a suite of programs
that is used to study biomolecular systems. The name references both the force
fields for simulation and the simulation software itself. This is some of the
information from the [Amber Manual](http://ambermd.org/Manuals.php), which is 
hundreds of pages of in-depth explanation. Additional information about Amber
(and the error messages that may arise) is available through the
[Amber Mailing List](http://archive.ambermd.org/).
