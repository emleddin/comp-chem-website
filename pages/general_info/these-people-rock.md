[Dr. Bill Miller III](http://brmiller.sites.truman.edu/)
originally gifted me the UNIX and AMBER manuals.

Mark A. Hix ([github](https://github.com/markahix),
[email](mailto://markahix@gmail.com)) and Dr. Alice R. Walker
([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2tmkmrkAAAAJ&hl=en))
wrote and/or shared several of the scripts that you see in these guides
(they're denoted accordingly).

The Jekyll theme that this site was built from was written by Tom Johnson.
It's available [here](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll).
