BRM3 originally gifted me the UNIX and AMBER manuals.

Mark A. Hix ([github(https://github.com/markahix)],
[email](mailto://markahix@gmail.com)) and ARW wrote several of the scripts that
you see in these guides (they're denoted accordingly).

The Jekyll theme this page was built from was written by Tom Johnson.
It's available [here](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll).
