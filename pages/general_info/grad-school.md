What is "grad school?" Like most answers to questions asked during graduate
school, "it depends."

* You can go to graduate school for anything, as long as you've completed
the prerequisites.

* You get to pick the focus area you become an expert in.

* It is possible to go to graduate school for free.

* It is possible to get paid to attend graduate school.

The thought bubbles include:
'exams...', 'specialized classes I care about', 'want the degree',
'1-5+ years', '$$$', 'job market', and 'different career options'.
The speech bubbles say 'It's either ramen or avocado toast for the next
5 years' and 'Professional student here I come!'"
