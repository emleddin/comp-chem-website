Hello! I'm Emmett (he/him or they/them) and I am a PhD Candidate in Physical
Chemistry.
I've been working on computational chemistry projects since 2015.
I started as an undergraduate doing drug docking, and I currently look at
how mutations impact the function and dynamics of proteins.
Outside of the lab, I'm the Graduate Student Networking Chair for
oSTEM@North Texas, serve on the mentorship team for the national oSTEM
organization, and I volunteer as a crisis counselor with Crisis Text Line
and THRIVE Lifeline.
