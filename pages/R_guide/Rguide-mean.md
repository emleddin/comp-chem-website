Taking the average of a variable is as easy as using `mean(variable)`.
```R
> spidersconsumed <- c(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,30)
> mean(spidersconsumed)
[1] 3
```
The average person eats 3 spiders per year. The child of Spiders Georg,
Spiders Meorg, ate 30 spiders, and kept the average in his class of 10 students.
Clearly, this lead to a statistical error, and the data would be better
represented another way.
