This is a list of commands and their contexts for getting started with using R.
R is a free programming language for statistical computing and graphics.
To download R, visit [cran](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and find
the location closest to you. Then, follow the instructions based on your
operating system. Many people who use R like the program RStudio, which has a
console and interface for using R. That can be downloaded for free under an
open source license from
[the RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

## Using R {#use-R}

R can be loaded from the command line with `R`. Easy enough. If you remember,
in Unix there is a `$` to tell you you're at the command line. 
For R's internal command line, that symbol is `>`.
To clear the console in R or RStudio on a Windows or Linux operating system,
use `Cntrl+L`. On a Mac, you can use either `Cntrl+L` or `Command+Option+L`.
