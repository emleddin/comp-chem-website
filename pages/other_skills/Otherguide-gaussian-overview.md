Gaussian is a program for computational chemistry. GaussView is the graphical
viewer that assists with using Gaussian.
Gaussian can be used for a variety of calculations, including molecular
orbitals, energies, vibrational frequencies, and structure.
Most of these explanations will be about how to use GaussView (to later use
Gaussian).

Calculate, Results, Windows, and Help. There are icons on the next three lines.
In the builder fragment window is a Carbon Tetrahedral with the carbon

## Navigation

| Mouse Button | Action | Use |
| ------------ | ------ | --- |
| Left         | Click  | Selects or adds item |
|              | Move left/right | Rotate y-axis |
|              | Move up/down | Rotate x-axis |
| Scroll       | Roll    | Zoom in/out molecule |
| Right        | Move left/right | Rotate z-axis |
|              | Move up/down | Zoom in/out molecule |

## Builder

The builder has a lot of buttons that each perform a different function. These
functions, spaced like the builder, are:

Element Fragment | Custom Fragment  
Ring fragment | R-group fragment | Biological fragment  
Fragment Choice  
Distance | Angle | Dihedral  
Inquire | Add hydrogen | Delete group  
Rotate | Click Atoms | Box-select | Drag-select  
New build window | Center window | Rebond  
Clean structure | Symmetrize | Builder Help  
Deselect all atoms | Select all atoms

alt="There are a number of icons. The top row has a periodic table and a book.
The next row has a hexagon, an R group, and a helix. The next line is a methane
fragment. The fourth line has a bond length button, an angle button, and a
dihedral button. The fifth line has a question mark, a hydrogen, and a red X.
The sixth line has a rotation, click, box-select, and drag-select. Line seven
has a new page, shrink, and rebond. The eighth line has a paintbrush, plane, and
questionmark. The final line has an arrow with grayed circles and an arrow with
yellow circles." caption="The GaussView builder." %}
