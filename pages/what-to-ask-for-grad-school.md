## PI-Specific {#ask-PI}
* What kind of lab management style do you have? Hands-on? Hands-off?
Do you have group meetings? Do you have one-on-one meetings?
* How often do you travel?
* Do you plan on moving? Do you want to move?
* Do you do any STEM outreach activities?
* How many publications do students usually graduate with?
* How many hours a week do you expect of your graduate students?
* How long do students usually take to graduate?
* Do you encourage attending conferences?
* What kind of resources does your laboratory have access to?
* What kinds of funding does the lab have?
* How many graduate students are you looking to take next year?
How many do you usually take?


## Program-Specific {#ask-program}

* Are there cumulative exams?
* How is the program set-up?
* Are there proficiency exams?
* Does the department have a seminar series?
* How are students and advisors paired? How likely is it I will get my #1?
* What is the policy on changing labs if you are unhappy later on?


## Student-Specific {#student}

* Do you like it here?
* Does your professor respect your boundaries/give you a break/understand that
you're a human being?
* What kinds of things do you hope to do after graduating from here?
Have other people that have gone here done something similar?
* What advice would you have for a new graduate student?
* What are some good places to live?
* How long does it actually take? How many hours do you actually work?
* What are some reasons people leave the department?


## General Considerations {#gencons}

* Are there multiple advisors I could reasonably work with at this school?
Do they have mentoring styles that I would thrive with?
* What will be expected of me at U of X vs U of Y?
Are the hours/responsibility/time off exceptionally different?
Do the people there seem like people I can work with?
* Would I be okay living there? Will I be able to live reasonably on my
stipend/financial aid/savings?
[Making budgets for different locations that factor in rent for the area helps.]
How far am I from family, and am I alright with that?
Are there opportunities for my spouse/significant other?
* Which schools have policies in place to protect me, if I'm in a
minority group? Are the environment and community accepting of my minority
group? Does the school offer mental health services? What happens if I get
married/get pregnant?


## To Ask Yourself {#ask-me}
* Can I reasonably see myself living here for 3-5+ years?
* Do these people seem like people I can get along with?
* How far am I from family with this program? Am I ok with that?
* What should I be doing this summer? Should I be working as much as possible
so I can afford to move? Should I be studying all day and night for proficiency
exams?
* Are there multiple professors I can seriously see myself working with, in
case I am unable to work with my #1?

## After a Decision {#after}

* What transportation options are there? Is parking on campus an issue?
Are there busses? Is it safe to ride a bike?
* Will I be able to have a student, staff, or either health insurance plan?
* What major branch banks are in the area (i.e., will I have to switch who I
    have my debit card with)?
* What mental health resources are available in the area?
[Even if you don't end up needing them, having done research on it may serve
useful to a friend.]
