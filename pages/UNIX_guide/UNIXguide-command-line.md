First, you’re going to need a way to access the command line.
If you’re on Linux or Mac machine, this is easy!
Both have applications that come with your computer named Terminal.
If you’re on a Windows device, you’ll need to download a Terminal emulator,
such as [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
or [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/).
After opening Terminal, you’ll probably feel like a hacker.
That’s cool. The feeling takes a long time to go away.

you are and which folder you’re in to the left of where you type. This bit ends
with a `$`, which will be shown in every command line example in this guide." %}
