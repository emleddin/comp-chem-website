Occasionally (or not occasionally, I don't know your life), you submit a command
 like [rsync](UNIXguide-rsync.html) or [scp](UNIXguide-scp.html) and you really
 wish you hadn't.
Maybe it's because it is taking too long and you can't keep your laptop open
for the length of time it needs to run, or maybe because you're missing a
crucial file for the operation.
Fear not! There's an abort command!
All you need to do is type `Cntrl+C` (like when you copy things in Microsoft
    Word).
[Note: anything that's been completed won't be undone.]
