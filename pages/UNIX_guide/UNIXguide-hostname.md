Have you ever forgotten which computer you're using?
Probably not, since most people aren't working with multiple systems at one
time.
But it can happen! Which is why `hostname` exists.
It's not always helpful, depending on what will be returned, and not always
necessary because most terminals include where you're connected, but it is an
option you can use.
```bash
$ hostname
hawkeye
```

{% include links.html %}
