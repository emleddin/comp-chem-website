To check user activity, and receive information such as reboot, boot, and
kernel version, you can use the  `last` command.
The kernel version is the central component to the operating system, and is
essential for memory, process, task, and disk management.
```bash
$ last
charlie	pts/8		  10.144.120.74		    Wed Mar 21 09:20	still logged in
reboot	system boot	  4.4.0-116-generi	    Thu Mar 15 15:06	still running
```
