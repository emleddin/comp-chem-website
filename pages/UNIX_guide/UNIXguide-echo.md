The `echo` command prints text to the screen.
It's incredibly useful in scripting, as it can be used to demonstrate how far
along a script has gotten during the run through printing statements or the time.
`echo` can also print variable locations to the screen, so if you need to
access that location without using the variable name, you don't have to search
your hidden files.
```bash
$ echo $AMBERHOME
/usr/local/amber18
```
