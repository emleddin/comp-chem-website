To set whether users can send you messages with the
[write](UNIXguide-who-write.html) command, use `mesg`.
Just typing `mesg` will register what your choice is currently set as (y allows
    messages to appear; n prevents messages from appearing).
To change the settings, use `mesg y` or `mesg n`, depending on the setting you
want.
