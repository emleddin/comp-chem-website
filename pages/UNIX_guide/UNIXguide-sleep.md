If you've ever wanted to pause a computer and make it practically unusable for
a set period of time, then the `sleep` command is for you.
The command syntax is `sleep X`, where `X` is the length of time in seconds you
would like the computer to sleep for.
It is likely that this may only be useful in scripts where you need to a make
sure a step has been completed.
