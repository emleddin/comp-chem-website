To search a file in the [vi](UNIXguide-vi.html) editor, use `/`.
First, use escape to enter any mode that you're in.
Then, type the forward slash before the text that you're searching for, and
hit enter.
This will bring you the the appearance of the string you're looking for.

Using the keyboard shortcut `Cntrl+B` allows you to go back when doing a string
search with `/`.
