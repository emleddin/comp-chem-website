# Comp-Chem-Website

This repository contains the website I've made to post the research guides
I've adapted, including an introduction to UNIX, setting up systems for the
AMBER programs, analyzing AMBER trajectories, and using the R programming
language.

The site was created using the
[Documentation Theme for Jekyll](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/documentation-theme-jekyll/)
template.

To build the site locally,
[install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and run:
```$ bundle exec jekyll serve```
